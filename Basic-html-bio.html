             <p>Hello Class my name is Freddy Rosales. I'm excited for the class and welcome the challenge that this course will bring. I'm a 20 year veteran of the USAF and am looking to start a new and exciting career as a web devloper. I'm from Panama City, Panama. I love to cook, workout, play sports, spend time with my family and go to the beach; I love to surf which I learned traveling to Panama every summer as a kid. It's hard to do that here in AZ so we make it to California as much as we can. I'm also an avid writer and am hoping my creativity and attention to detail can help me be successful in this new career.</p>
